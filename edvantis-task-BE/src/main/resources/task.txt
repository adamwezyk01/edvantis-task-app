Assignment: Emergency Call Management System

Objective: Develop a full stack application to manage emergency calls, with a strong emphasis on backend development.
The backend should be built using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and a database of your choice. The frontend should be a reactive application built with React and TypeScript.

Requirements:
Backend:
Spring Boot Application:
- Create a Spring Boot application with RESTful APIs.
- Use Hibernate for ORM.
- Implement CRUD operations for managing emergency call data.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation.

Database:
- Choose any relational database.
- Design tables to store emergency call information.
- Include the name of the caller, the position, the type of the incident (e.g., Fire, Crime, Accident), and the status of the emergency.

APIs:
- Create endpoints for adding, changing, and deleting data.
- Implement pagination and filtering for retrieving emergency call data.

Unit Tests:
- Write unit tests for the logic of the application.
- Ensure high test coverage for all critical components.

Security:
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Ensure secure data transmission and storage.
Frontend:
React Application:
Create a reactive React / TypeScript application.
Implement a dashboard to display emergency call data.
Provide forms to add, update, and delete emergency calls.
Consume the backend services with React
Deliverables:
Source code for the backend and frontend applications.
Documentation on how to set up and run the application.
